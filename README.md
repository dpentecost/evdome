WIP for East Village Planetarium

A place to stash useful code and lessons learned as we work in several areas:
Unity - for dome production
Processing - for a large outdoor LED sculptural stairway - the Coderpillar
The Pleiades Sisters - SF storytelling by girls in the dome
Uniview - Planetarium software
