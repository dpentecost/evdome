# evdome
WIP for East Village Planetarium, Lower Eastside Girls Club

A place to stash useful code and lessons learned as we work in several areas:

Unity - for dome production

Processing - for a large outdoor LED sculptural stairway - the Coderpillar

The Pleiades Sisters - SF storytelling by girls in the dome

Uniview - Planetarium software

Last but not least:

A class on GitHub!

(How to make it accessible for teens, if adults find it inscrutable!)
